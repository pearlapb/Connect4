# Connect4

Made a Connect 4 game using vanilla JavaScript. Game created in my 3rd week at SPICED Academy.

The game is played by two users who must give their name. Two different coloured checkers with their initials show who's turn it is. Players win if they manage to lay 4 of their checkers in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. The game therefore checks for all those types of wins and gets colourful and happy when someone wins!
